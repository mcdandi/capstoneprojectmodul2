# Transjakarta Analysis

This project provides an analysis of **Transjakarta**, Jakarta’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system, aimed at addressing operational challenges and enhancing service quality for its passengers. Established in 2004, Transjakarta was developed to reduce traffic congestion in Jakarta by providing safe, affordable, and efficient public transportation.

## Background

Transjakarta, the first BRT network in Southeast Asia, operates with dedicated lanes across 13 main corridors and key areas in Jakarta, supporting sustainable urban mobility. Despite its growth and significant role in the city, Transjakarta faces several challenges impacting passenger satisfaction:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Key BRT stations experience severe congestion during peak hours, leading to long queues and extended wait times, sometimes up to two hours. This highlights the need for optimization in fleet management and service frequency on busy routes.
- **Service Distribution by Location and Time**: Passenger volumes peak in business and office districts during rush hours, necessitating strategic fleet allocation and adjustments to service frequency based on demand patterns.
- **Infrastructure Quality and Station Accessibility**: Many passengers face issues with limited access and poor station conditions, affecting comfort and accessibility. Upgraded facilities are essential to make stations more user-friendly and accessible.
- **Digital Payment Usage**: With increasing use of e-money options like Flazz, Brizzi, TapCash, and JakLingko, digital payments have become popular among passengers. Assessing whether this impacts customer loyalty and ticket repurchasing behavior is important for service improvements.

## Problem Statement

This analysis addresses the following critical challenges for Transjakarta:

1. **Operational Efficiency**: How can inefficiencies in daily operations be reduced?
2. **Customer Demographics**: What are the main demographic segments of Transjakarta's passengers?
3. **Service Timing and Location Optimization**: When and where should Transjakarta focus its service efforts to maximize efficiency?
4. **Digital Payment Impact**: Does the adoption of digital payment methods influence passenger repurchasing behavior?

## Objectives

The project’s primary objectives are as follows:

1. **Increase Operational Efficiency**: Optimize routes and service frequency to reduce passenger wait times and ease congestion.
2. **Understand Customer Demographics**: Analyze demographic data to better understand passenger characteristics and preferences.
3. **Service Timing and Location Optimization**: Identify peak times and locations to strategically deploy resources and improve service.
4. **Evaluate Digital Payment Impact**: Assess whether digital payments impact customer loyalty and ticket purchase frequency.

## Scenario

This analysis provides insights to help stakeholders make informed decisions that enhance Transjakarta’s operations and customer satisfaction:

- **Director**: Oversees all business decisions to ensure alignment with company goals.
- **Marketing Manager**: Manages Transjakarta’s marketing and advertising strategies.
- **Finance Manager**: Handles financial planning and budgeting for Transjakarta.

## Data and Methodology

The dataset includes detailed information on customer demographics, payment methods, and operational patterns for Transjakarta. Using descriptive and statistical analysis, this project aims to uncover insights into service distribution, customer demographics, and digital payment behavior.

## Conclusion

Findings from this project offer actionable insights for Transjakarta to enhance service quality, optimize operational efficiency, and better meet the needs of Jakarta’s diverse population, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction.
